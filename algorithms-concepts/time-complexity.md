# Time Complexity

## Logrithm,ic Tim,e

* Assumption is log base 2 in computer sceince
  * Same is log bas 10 in calculus
* For a balanced binary tree the complexity would be log(n) because the nodes double at eacch point
* Also binary sear when dividing the search space by 2 at every decision
* Halving the search space

$$
f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}
