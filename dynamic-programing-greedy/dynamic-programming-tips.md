# Dynamic Programming Tips

## Memoization vs Tabulation

* Memoization (remember recursion)
  * Top down approach where you solve main problem and break it down into smaller sub-problems recursively
  * If sub problem has already been solved result is retrieved from a cache instead of being recomputed
* Dynamic Programming
  * Bottom up where you solve all possible subproblems first and use their solutions to build up the solution to the main problem
  * Iterative
